I'm having trouble with the Image Classification Project. For some reason I cannot get the
accuracy to go over 50%. Something very strange happens, as demonstrated in the print attached:
after some number of iterations the accuracy drops to around 10% (like random guessing).

First point: is my implementation of the print_stats function correct? I fixed it from the last
time I submitted the project but I'm not sure yet.

Second point: how can the cost be dropping but the accuracy remain the same? I think this two
stats should have some correlation, right? If I'm wrong, could you please explain why?
